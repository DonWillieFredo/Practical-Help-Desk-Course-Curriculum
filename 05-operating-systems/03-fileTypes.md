### File types are essentially the way computers organize and understand different kinds of data. Think of it like different kinds of documents in a filing cabinet â€“ each has a specific purpose and is handled in a particular way.

### We encounter file types all the time. For example, when you see a document with ".docx" at the end, you know it's likely a Microsoft Word file. Or a picture might end in ".jpg" or ".png". These extensions tell your computer what program to use to open the file and how to interpret the information inside.

## There are tons of different file types out there, each designed for specific kinds of data, like:

* **Documents:** These hold text and formatting, like reports, essays, or letters. Common types include .docx, .pdf, .txt, and .odt.
* **Images:** These store visual information. Popular formats include .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, and .tiff.
* **Audio:** These contain sound data, like music or recordings. You'll see formats like .mp3, .wav, .aac, and .flac.
* **Videos:** These combine audio and visual data for movies, clips, and presentations. Common types are .mp4, .avi, .mov, and .wmv.
* **Executable Files:** These contain instructions that tell your computer to run a program. On Windows, these often end in .exe or .msi.
* **Compressed Files:** These are archives that bundle multiple files together to save space. Common formats include .zip and .rar.

#### Understanding file types can be really helpful for knowing how to open, edit, and share different kinds of files on your computer.
