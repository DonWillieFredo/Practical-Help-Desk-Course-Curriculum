## Motherboard
##  The motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in your computer. It acts as the central communication hub, connecting all the different components, including the GPU, CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals. Here's what you should know:

## Connectivity: The motherboard provides the slots, sockets, and connectors that allow all the hardware components to interface with each other.   
## Chipset: A crucial set of integrated circuits on the motherboard that manages the communication between the CPU, RAM, GPU, and other peripherals. It essentially directs traffic within the system.   
## Expansion Slots: These slots, such as PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express), allow you to add expansion cards like discrete GPUs, sound cards, and network cards. The motherboard will have one or more full-length PCIe x16 slots specifically designed for high-bandwidth devices like graphics cards.   
## CPU Socket: This is where the CPU is installed. The type of socket on the motherboard must match the type of CPU you are using.
## RAM Slots: These slots hold the system's Random Access Memory (RAM) modules. The motherboard dictates the type and speed of RAM that can be used.   
## Storage Connectors: Connectors like SATA and M.2 allow you to connect hard drives and solid-state drives for data storage.   
## Power Connectors: The motherboard receives power from the power supply unit (PSU) through various connectors and distributes it to all the connected components.   
## BIOS/UEFI: The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is firmware stored on a chip on the motherboard. It initializes the system hardware during the boot process and provides basic input/output functions.
