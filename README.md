# üñ•Ô∏è Will Esver's Help Desk Support Learning Journey

Welcome to my learning repository! My name is **Will Esver**, and I'm transitioning into a new career in Help Desk Support after being recently laid off. While I've dabbled in various technologies, including software development, I'm now focused on building a solid foundation in IT support to land a help desk role.

## üéØ Why Help Desk Support?

I'm passionate about technology and problem-solving, and I see Help Desk Support as the perfect entry point into the IT field. I'm committed to learning the essential skills needed to troubleshoot, assist users, and manage systems effectively.

## Current Course

I'm currently enrolled in the [**Practical Help Desk**](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/phda/) course by **TCM Security**. This course provides real-world, hands-on training to prepare for the PHDA (Practical Help Desk Associate) certification, which I plan to take after completing the course.
