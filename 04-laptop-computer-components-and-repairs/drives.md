## Drives
### These are where your data lives! There are a couple of main types of drives you'll find in laptops:

### Hard Disk Drives (HDDs): These are traditional storage devices that use spinning magnetic platters to store and retrieve data. They tend to offer more storage for a lower cost per gigabyte but are generally slower and more susceptible to physical shock. You'll see their speed measured in revolutions per minute (RPM).
### Solid State Drives (SSDs): These are the newer and increasingly common type of drive. They use flash memory chips to store data, similar to a USB drive but much faster. SSDs offer significant advantages in terms of speed (faster boot times, application loading, and file transfers), durability (no moving parts), and energy efficiency. They might be a bit more expensive per gigabyte than HDDs.

Laptops can come with either an HDD, an SSD, or sometimes a combination of both (an SSD for the operating system and frequently used applications, and an HDD for mass storage). There are also different interfaces for these drives, such as SATA and the faster NVMe, which you'll typically see with SSDs.
