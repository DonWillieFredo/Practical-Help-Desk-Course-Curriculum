## CMOS Battery
### Think of this as the laptop's short-term memory for essential settings. CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) is a type of memory that requires very little power to retain information. The small CMOS battery, often a coin-cell type (like a CR2032), provides this power even when the laptop is turned off and unplugged. It stores crucial information like:

## System date and time: This ensures your clock is always accurate. 

## BIOS/UEFI settings: These are the fundamental settings for how your laptop boots up and what hardware is recognized. Without a functioning CMOS battery, your laptop might lose these settings, leading to boot-up issues or an incorrect date and time.

### Interestingly, some newer laptops are moving away from a separate CMOS battery and instead use a small capacitor charged by the main battery to maintain these settings.
