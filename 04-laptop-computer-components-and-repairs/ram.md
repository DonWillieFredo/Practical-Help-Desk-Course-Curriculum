## RAM
RAM (Random Access Memory) is your laptop's short-term working memory. When you open an application or a file, it's loaded into RAM so your processor can access it quickly. The more RAM you have, the more applications and data you can have open and readily accessible at the same time, leading to smoother multitasking.



RAM is measured in gigabytes (GB), and its speed is often described by its generation (like DDR4 or the newer DDR5) and its clock speed in megahertz (MHz). Faster RAM can improve performance, especially in memory-intensive tasks like video editing or gaming. Laptops use a smaller form factor of RAM called SO-DIMM (Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module).
