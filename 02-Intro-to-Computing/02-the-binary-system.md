## The Binary Number System is fundamental to how computers function internally.

### Definition: Binary is a number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is often referred to as Base 2.

### Why Computers Use It: This simplicity makes it perfect for computers. The two states, 0 and 1, can easily be represented by electrical signals, similar to a light switch being off (0) or on (1).

### Positional Value: Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2. For example, in the binary number 1011, the positions represent 2^3, 2^2, 2^1, and 2^0 from left to right.

### Conversion to Decimal: To convert a binary number to decimal (Base 10), you multiply each digit by the corresponding power of 2 for its position and sum the results. The source provides the example: 1011₂ = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11₁₀.

### Role in Computing: Binary is the fundamental building block for internal computer processing. It is the very low-level language of 0s and 1s that computers ultimately speak. The Central Processing Unit (CPU) understands instructions in machine code, which is described as the language the CPU understands, and is fundamentally composed of 0s and 1s.

### Encoding, the process of converting information into a format computers can understand, involves translating information into the language of bits and bytes, which are based on binary (a bit is a single binary digit, and a byte is typically 8 bits).

### Relationship to Hexadecimal (Base 16): Hexadecimal is often used in computing as a more human-friendly way to represent binary numbers. Because 16 is a power of 2 (16 = 2⁴), there's a direct and easy conversion. Crucially, one hexadecimal digit can represent exactly four binary digits (bits). This relationship makes conversions straightforward and allows working with larger chunks of binary data in a more compact and readable format. For example, the binary number 11110000₂ is much more compactly represented as F0₁₆.

## In summary, the binary number system is the essential low-level language understood by computer hardware, representing data and instructions using only two states (0 and 1) which can be easily managed by electrical signals. While humans interact with computers using higher-level languages and abstractions, compilers translate these into the machine code of 0s and 1s. Hexadecimal is a useful tool for representing this underlying binary data in a more manageable form.
