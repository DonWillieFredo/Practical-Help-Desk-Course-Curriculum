## At a high level, a computer computes by following a series of instructions that tell it what to do with data. Think of it like a very fast and complex recipe follower.

### Input: First, the computer needs information to work with. This input can come from various sources like a keyboard, mouse, microphone, or even a file stored on its hard drive.

### Processing: This is where the "computing" happens. The central processing unit (CPU), often referred to as the "brain" of the computer, takes the input data and performs calculations and logical operations based on the instructions it receives from software. These instructions are in a language the CPU understands, often referred to as machine code.

### Memory: While the CPU is processing, it needs a place to temporarily store the data it's currently working on and the instructions it's about to execute. This is where memory, specifically RAM (Random Access Memory), comes in. It provides fast access to the information the CPU needs.

### Output: Once the CPU has processed the data according to the instructions, the result needs to be presented to the user or another system. This output can take many forms, such as displaying text or images on a monitor, playing sound through speakers, printing a document, or sending data over a network.

### Storage: For long-term keeping of data and instructions (like your operating system, applications, and files), computers use storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSDs). This allows the computer to access this information again even after it's been turned off.

## Essentially, a computer takes input, uses the CPU to process that input based on instructions stored in memory and on storage, and then produces output. This entire process happens incredibly quickly, allowing computers to perform complex tasks in fractions of a second.
