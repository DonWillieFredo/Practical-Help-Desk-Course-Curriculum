## What Are Windows OS Services?

**Windows Services** are specialized background applications that run without a user interface or direct user interaction. They are essential for managing system-level functions and supporting various applicationsâ€”think of them as the silent workhorses of Windows.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Start automatically:** Many services launch at system boot, before any user logs in.
- **Run independently:** Services operate regardless of user sessions and continue running after logoff.
- **Handle background tasks:** Ideal for continuous functions like networking, security, logging, and hardware management.
- **Operate with specific permissions:** Services run under accounts like Local System, Network Service, or Local Service, each with different privileges for security.

> **Note:** Windows services are similar to "daemons" in Unix-like systems.

## Common Categories and Examples

### System Management
- **Windows Update:** Downloads and installs updates and patches.
- **Task Scheduler:** Automates tasks and runs programs at set times/events.
- **Windows Time:** Syncs system time with internet servers.
- **Print Spooler:** Manages print jobs.

### Network Services
- **DNS Client:** Resolves and caches domain names.
- **Workstation (LanmanWorkstation):** Manages network connections to remote servers.
- **Server (LanmanServer):** Shares files/printers over the network.
- **DHCP Client:** Automatically obtains IP/network configuration.

### Security and Control
- **Windows Defender:** Real-time malware protection.
- **Security Center:** Monitors security settings and alerts.
- **Firewall:** Filters network traffic for protection.

### Application Support
- Many third-party apps (e.g., SQL Server, IIS) install their own services to run in the background.

## Managing Windows Services

### Services Console (`services.msc`)
- **Access:** Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter.
- **Features:**
    - View all services, their status, and startup type.
    - Start, stop, pause, resume, or restart services.
    - Change startup type: Automatic, Automatic (Delayed Start), Manual, Disabled.
    - View dependencies between services.
    - Configure recovery actions if a service fails.

### Task Manager
- **Access:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` or right-click the Taskbar > Task Manager.
- **Services Tab:** View running services, PIDs, and start/stop them.

### Command Line (CMD/PowerShell)
- **`sc` command:** Advanced service management.
    - `sc query [service name]`
    - `sc start [service name]`
    - `sc stop [service name]`
    - `sc config [service name] start= <startup_type>`
- **`net` command:** Basic start/stop.
    - `net start [service name]`
    - `net stop [service name]`
- **PowerShell cmdlets:**
    - `Get-Service`
    - `Start-Service [service name]`
    - `Stop-Service [service name]`
    - `Set-Service [service name] -StartupType <type>`
    - `Restart-Service [service name]`

## Best Practices

- **Check dependencies:** Before stopping/disabling a service, review its dependencies to avoid breaking other functions.
- **Use least privilege:** Run services under the lowest-privilege account necessary.
- **Be cautious disabling services:** Only disable services you are certain are unnecessary.
- **Document changes:** Keep records of service configuration changes.
- **Monitor service health:** Use Event Viewer, Performance Monitor, or third-party tools.
- **Test before production:** Try changes in a test environment first.
