### Installing and Uninstalling Software

**Installing Software:**

Windows offers several ways to install applications, depending on the software's packaging:

* **Microsoft Store (Modern Apps):** This is the most straightforward method for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.
    1. Open the **Microsoft Store** app.
    2. Search for the desired application.
    3. Click "Get" or "Install" to download and install. These installations are typically sandboxed, making them secure and easy to manage.

* **Executable Files (.exe or .msi):** This is common for traditional desktop applications.
    1. Locate the installer file (e.g., `setup.exe`, `install.msi`).
    2. Double-click the file to launch the installation wizard.
    3. Follow the on-screen prompts, which usually involve accepting license agreements, choosing installation directories, and selecting components. Pay attention to custom installation options to avoid unwanted bundled software.
    4. Most installations require administrator privileges, so you may be prompted for a password or UAC (User Account Control) confirmation.

* **Third-Party Package Managers (e.g., Chocolatey, Winget):** For advanced users or automated deployments, these tools simplify the installation of many open-source and freeware applications via command line.
    * **Chocolatey:** `choco install <package_name>`
    * **Winget:** `winget install <package_id>`

**Uninstalling Software:**

Properly uninstalling software is crucial to prevent leftover files and potential system instability.

* **Settings App (Recommended for most apps):**
    1. Go to **Start > Settings > Apps > Apps & features**.
    2. Scroll or search for the application you want to uninstall.
    3. Click on the app, then click "Uninstall."
    4. Follow any on-screen prompts from the uninstaller.

* **Control Panel (For older desktop applications):**
    1. Open the **Control Panel** (search for it in the Start menu).
    2. Navigate to **Programs > Programs and Features**.
    3. Select the application from the list.
    4. Click "Uninstall/Change" at the top.
    5. Follow the uninstaller wizard.

* **Using the Application's Uninstaller:** Some applications include their own dedicated uninstaller, often found in the program's installation directory or listed in the Start Menu folder.

* **Command Line (for Winget/Chocolatey installs):**
    * **Winget:** `winget uninstall <package_id>`
    * **Chocolatey:** `choco uninstall <package_name>`

**Troubleshooting Uninstallation Issues:**
If an application fails to uninstall, consider:
* Running a dedicated uninstallation tool provided by the software vendor.
* Using Microsoft's Program Install and Uninstall troubleshooter.
* Manually removing leftover files and registry entries (use extreme caution with the registry editor - `regedit`).

### Local File Permissions

Windows uses the NTFS (New Technology File System) file system, which provides robust security features through permissions. Permissions determine who can access files and folders and what actions they can perform.

**Understanding Permissions:**

* **Users/Groups:** Permissions are assigned to specific user accounts or user groups (e.g., "Administrators," "Users," "SYSTEM").
* **Permissions Types:**
    * **Read:** View the contents of a file or list the contents of a folder.
    * **Write:** Change the contents of a file or create new files/folders.
    * **Read & Execute:** View and run executable files.
    * **Modify:** Read, write, and delete files/folders.
    * **Full Control:** Complete control over the file/folder, including changing permissions.
* **Inheritance:** By default, subfolders and files inherit permissions from their parent folder. This simplifies management but can be overridden.

**Viewing and Modifying Permissions:**

1. **Right-click** on the file or folder you want to inspect.
2. Select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Security** tab.
4. Under "Group or user names," select a user or group to see their assigned permissions.
5. To change permissions, click **Edit**. You may need administrator privileges.
    * Add or remove users/groups.
    * Check or uncheck permission boxes.
6. To configure advanced permissions or inheritance, click **Advanced**.
    * **Effective Access:** See what permissions a user *actually* has, considering all group memberships.
    * **Disable inheritance:** Break the link to the parent folder's permissions, allowing for unique settings.
    * **Add/Remove/Edit permissions entries:** Fine-tune specific access rules.

**Common Scenarios for Adjusting Permissions:**

* **Sharing files:** Ensuring specific users have read-only or full access to shared documents.
* **Application issues:** Sometimes, applications require specific write permissions to their data folders to function correctly.
* **Security hardening:** Restricting access to sensitive configuration files or system folders.

**Best Practices:**

* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for users or applications to function.
* **Use Groups:** Assign permissions to groups rather than individual users for easier management.
* **Avoid "Everyone" with Full Control:** This can be a significant security risk.
